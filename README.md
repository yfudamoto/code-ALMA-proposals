__Estimate_IRflux.ipynb__: This will calculate IR fluxes for arbitarary wavelength (8-1000um) using pre-calculated FIR SED templates

__Duplicate_check.ipynb__: This will search oin-going duplicate observations by object positions.

__Search_ALMA-archive.ipynb__: This will search your targest in ALMA archive using Alminer. ALMINR is very slow. so it'll be better to use ALMA archive directly if you have a small sample.
